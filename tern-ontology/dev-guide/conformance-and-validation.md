# Conformance and Validation

:::info
This section is in draft. The content and structure of the document may change until it is released.

This section describes how to validate and ensure the data you receive or submit is conforming to the TERN Ontology using Shaped Constraint Language (SHACL), a language to validate Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs aganist a set of conditions. 

## Validation with SHACL



## What it doesn't do

The constraints defined with SHACL in the TERN Ontology does not check domain and protocol specific details. Example, it does not check if a categorical value is valid for an observation at the survey protocol level. However, if required, these constraints can be implemented by adopters of the TERN Ontology.
