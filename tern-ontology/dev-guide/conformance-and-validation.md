This section describes how to validate and ensure the data you receive or submit is conforming to the TERN Ontology. 

## Validation with SHACL

## What it doesn't do

The constraints defined with SHACL in the TERN Ontology does not check domain and protocol specific details.

However, if required, these constraints can be implemented by adopters of the TERN Ontology.
